### 1. Creating and Manipulating Objects
   - The creation and alteration/manipulation of a cubic mesh.
   - Create randomly positioned instances of the same cube.  
### 2. Working with Selections and Constraints
   - Create instances of the first object selected.
   - Apply an aim constraint on all the selected objects towards the first object selected.
### 3. Creating a Scripted Animation
   - Apply a full 360 degree rotation to the currently selected objects by scripting the creation of Key Frames.
   - Filter for specific object types in the user selection.
   - Convert this animation code into a designated function. This will apply the rotation animation to each instance object.
### 4. Generating a User Interface
   - Display a window containing various input fields (plus Apply and Cancel buttons).
   - This window lets the user provide their own inputs to the animation function in section 3
### 5. Custom Attributes and Expressions
   - Add custom attributes to a scene object. 
   - Create expressions to drive the value of other object's attributes.
   - Essentially, control the position of transform nodes relative to a central object.
